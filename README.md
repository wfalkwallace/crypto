Cryptographic functions and experiments to get to know some simple cryptosystems.

Caeser Cipher: C program for some simple Caeser cipher encryption/decryption
Vigenére: Ruby Program to play with Vigenére Ciphers (also my first ruby program). Plus, I have a theory that you could optimize your key and keylength to minimize character frequency distribution cracks. Let's see.

RSA:

DH:
