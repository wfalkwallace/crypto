######Cryptographic functions and experiments to get to know some simple cryptosystems.

1. Caeser Cipher: C program for some simple Caeser cipher encryption/decryption (affine w/ 0 multiplicative offset)
2. Affine Cipher: C program for Affine cipher
3. Vigenére: C Program to play with Vigenére Ciphers. Plus, I have a theory that you could optimize your key and keylength to minimize character frequency distribution cracks. Let's see.
4. RSA: TBD
5. DH: TBD
6. El Gamal: TBD
7. Morse: Not a cryptosystem, but a fun translator. Ruby mostly because dictionaries are so nice. Also my first ruby program.
8. Mersenne Twister: Python Mersenne Twister PRNG implementation.
